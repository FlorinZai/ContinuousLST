# ContinuousLST
The LSTcont dataset can be used for various applications and studies. As shown in the validation process, the LSTcontcan predict LST in cloudy pixels more accurately than other datasets. Furthermore, datasets for other regions can easily be produced by the GEE platform with the provided code. Due to the significant influence of the temperature seasonality on the algorithm, cautions should be taken when running the code on regions with very low seasonality such as the equatorial regions.
For producing the dataset in other regions, one should first run MODIS_TFA_Daily_Mean_Export_2_Assets and MODIS_TFA_Daily_Mean_Export_2_Assets codes to produce the TFAs. Only after both files, MODIS TFA and CFSv2 TFA are ready, Continuous_LST_Daily_Export code file can be used to produce 〖LST〗_cont. Different code files were prepared for day, night and daily datasets.
